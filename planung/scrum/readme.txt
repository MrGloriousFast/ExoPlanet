This is our project planning folder loosly following the scrum idea.

ideaBox:
write idea into a txt file or picture. try to have a new file for every idea.

frozenFeatures:
Ideas from the ideaBox will be reworked into smaller features. each feature should receive an estimate of  time needed to be implemented. If features take more than 2 hours try to split then into smaller features.
Template for frozenFeature:
000decriptiveName.txt
#Name
#Describtion
#estimated time


inProgressFeatures:
When you work on a feature make sure to move it into the inProgressFolder and add your name to it. Please write down the time you spend on working on it so we can later verify our estimate.
template:
#Name
#Describtion
#estimated time
#in progress by: developer name
#time spent (in 15 min intervals)


codeReview:
features that are complete have to undergo a code review. In this code review everything from comments to name variables will be discussed and if the code does not fit the requirements it will be put back into the inProgress folder.
